# vehicle_parking_system
This is my MAD 1 course project

This project tries to develop an application to solve the problem of reserving parking spots for 4 wheelers in high traffic zones. The app can be used by both users and admin. 

Features: Core features include user registration and login, secure session management, and the ability for users to view, book, and release parking spots. Administrators can add, edit, and delete parking lots, view parking spots details, summaries and analytics of parking usage. The UI is responsive and styled using Bootstrap, with enhancements such as dynamic charts (using Matplotlib) for visual summaries. Additional features include mobile responsiveness enhancement.
